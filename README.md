# jklm.fun-bot

Another word game bot I made. This bot was created under 10 minutes.
This bot was kind of made on a whim, so if there are bugs, srry.

Again, I say this in all of my projects, but IDK how the licensing thing works.
You can edit, duplicate, sell, delete, idrc. You can do whatever you want with my code. 
Although I don't think anybody would touch it anyways

if anybody is reading this rn at 9:58PM 5/3/2022 in Central Daylight Time, I have an 
AP compsci exam (AP exam) tomorrow. Wish me luck. I hate JAVA, C++ is better. I hope I don't flunk
